IMC-Java
# Calculator de IMC en Java

## Project description
This Java application allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by entering their weight in kilograms and their height in meters. BMI is an indicator used to evaluate a person's physical health in relation to their weight and height.

## OProject objectives
1. Understand the basic concepts of data entry and mathematical calculations in Java.
2. Implement logic using appropriate formulas to calculate BMI.

## Requirements
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- Familiarity with inputting and outputting data in the Java console.

## Bonuses
- Provide a description of the BMI range obtained.

## Use of the Application
1. Run the file `IMCCalculator.java`.
2. Enter the weight in kilograms when prompted.
3. Enter the height in meters when prompted.
4. View the BMI result and the corresponding category.

## BMI calculation
BMI is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{\text{height (m)}^2} \]

## BMI Categories
- Severe thinness: BMI < 16
- Moderate thinness: 16 <= BMI < 17
- Mild Thinness: 17 <= BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 25
- Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 30
- Mild Obesity: 30 <= BMI 35
- Moderate Obesity: 35 <= BMI 40
- Morbid obesity: BMI >= 40

## Resources
- Technical specifications for calculating BMI and healthy value ranges.
- Access to videos and online resources on Java programming.
